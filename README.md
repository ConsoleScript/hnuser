THIS IS FOR CHROME. 

If requested I will create a Firefox version.

Check hnuser-screenshot.png to see how it works.

How to Use?
-Download the Folder
-Extract it somewhere.
-Open chrome and type: chrome://extensions
-Select LOAD UNPACKED.

How to change the delay?
-Change the value near the bottom of content.js: "}, 500);"  to whatever value you desire.
-Do not change it to 0 so it won't request immediately when you hover.
