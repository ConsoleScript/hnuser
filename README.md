THIS IS FOR CHROME. 

If requested I will create a Firefox version.

Check hnuser-screenshot.png to see how it works.


How to Use?

-Download the Folder

-Extract it somewhere.

-Open chrome and type: chrome://extensions

-Select the folder you extracted.

-Select LOAD UNPACKED and it will run on news.ycombinator.com when you hover on a user after 0.5 second. 


How to change the delay?

-Change the value near the bottom of content.js: "}, 500);"  to whatever value you desire.

-Do not change it to 0 so it won't request immediately when you hover.
